### **Big Data and Information Systems Research**
By Microsoft, businesses today operate on the monitor-mine-manage (M3) cycle: they monitor and archive large amounts of data, which they mine to derive insights such as models. The models are used during the manage phase to add value to the business, e.g., by scoring the models with real-time data. For the efficient and effective application of bigdata, the research of IDS Lab strongly concentrate on these subtopic.
