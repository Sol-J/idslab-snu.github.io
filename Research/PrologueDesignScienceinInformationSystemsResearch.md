Design science research is yet another “lens” or set of analytical techniques and perspectives (complementing the Positivist and Interpretive perspectives) for performing research in IS. Design science research involves the design of novel or innovative artifacts and the analysis of the use and/or performance of such artifacts to improve and understand the behavior of aspects of Information Systems. 

Such artifacts include – but certainly are not limited to – algorithms (e.g. for information retrieval), human/computer interfaces and system design methodologies or languages. design science researchers can be found in many disciplines and fields, notably Engineering and Computer Science, using a variety of approaches, methods and techniques. In Information Systems, following a number of years of a general shift in IS research away from technological to managerial and organizational issues, an increasing number of observers are calling for a return to an exploration of the “IT” that underlies all IS research (http://derist.org).
