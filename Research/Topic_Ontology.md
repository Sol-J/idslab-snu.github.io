# Topic – Ontology

![research6](/pic/research/research6.png)

Ontology means a study on existence. It is rooted in the philosophy of being. What is a tree? What is soil? How do they interact with? What are things compose of them? Those questions are ontological questions. Since a human is a thinking animal, we never stop to questioning everything. This nature has provided a power to survive in the risky and harsh world. If we did not know differences between poison and food, the mankind would not remain alive. Ontological problems are critical for human beings.

Today, businesses are in fierce battlefields. Natural resources are consumed faster than decades ago. Customer’s needs are changing and flourishing. Companies try to innovate themselves to create a new marketplace where other competitors lose their strategic advantages. How can we control all information to avoid risks and catch opportunities? The answer should begin with the way to understand beings with regard to businesses. A manager needs to understand customers better, and a supplier needs to understand a client better. Knowledge is the most important asset to compete; therefore, it is indispensible to spend time in organizing things about knowledge.

Ontology design is an activity to develop and manage meta-knowledge on knowledge assets for businesses. An ontology is a specification of concepts and relationships within a defined domain of information system knowledge. The reason why we use a countable noun is that computer agents can use multiple specifications. Let’s suppose that a computer has a term like an apple in a database. The thing can be expressed in a different language; however, the meaning should be the same. If a medical information system had a lymphoma in a patient record, the other systems should understand it as a cancer. Those vocabularies are shared and commonly used in a certain knowledge domain. Ontology design is to (1) define definitions of shared vocabularies, (2) structuralize terms, (3) manage company’s resources and capabilities to maximize utilities of using ontologies and (4) refresh the system by injecting new definitions.

Research on ontology design consists of three areas: conceptual data modeling, ontology engineering and folksonomy study. First, conceptual data modeling is to study how to develop and use modeling grammars. Based on understanding about information technologies and business requirements, researchers try to define ontological expressions to capture knowledge from the real world. Additionally, they study how to improve productivity and usability of modeling grammars. Secondly, ontology engineering refers to an activity that increases efficiency and effectiveness of applications of ontologies. It is a huge challenge to collect and distribute knowledge from sizable sources. Obviously, the rapid growth of the Internet brings an explosion of providing knowledge. However, it becomes more difficult to handle data timely and meaningfully. Especially, today’s global businesses produce a number of knowledge sources that should be integrated and managed in a common point of view. Finally, knowledge grows and changes. Folksonomy is a newly created knowledge rooted in real transactions. For example, game terminologies, such as gj (good job), brb (be right back) and kk (Ok and Ok), have never used before populating a massive multi-user online game. Folksonomy study is to develop computational methods that discover new definitions from transactional data generated by customers. All research directions mentioned above aim to foster better chances to discover values from information systems. Conclusively, ontology design research intends to accumulate knowledge on design theories by developing and evaluating purposeful artifacts that enrich customers’ life value.
